# rug_phd_thesis_template
This repo contains the template for [my PhD thesis at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen](http://hdl.handle.net/11370/0f7c3d17-9661-4b9f-a27c-dfac2990b844).
It includes my chapter on Voids and Dark Energy as a working example (which was [also published in MNRAS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426..440B)).

The only requirements to compile this template as it is are:
* A recent version of TeXLive (2016 and 2017 should work)
* [My bibliography, which is in a separate repo](https://bitbucket.org/egpbos/egpbib)

Please feel free to use and/or modify this template as you see fit.
If you make some nice additions, please consider forking this repo and publishing your additions so that others may benefit too.

This template was a living document floating around the Kapteyn Institute for at least a decade.
As far as I could trace, its family tree consists of the PhD theses of Bruno Letarte (2006), Matias Arrigoni (2010), Thomas Martinsson (2011), Stephan Peters (2014) and Patrick Bos (2016).
